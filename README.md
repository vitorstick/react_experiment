# react_experiment

This is a react exploration with custom webpack, and jest for unit testing.

For me as a developer more focuses in Angular, this was an opportunity to gain experience in React.

# unit tests

For testing used jest, enzyme, and react testing tools

unit testing focused on, but other components have testing as well:

src\containers\Schedules\Schedules.test.tsx

src\components\Schedule\Schedule.test.tsx

Code coverage was not considered important as this was just an assessment.

# to deploy
